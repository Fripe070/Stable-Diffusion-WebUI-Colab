# Stable-Diffusion-WebUI-Colab
A notebook for google colaboratory, providing an easy way to use AUTOMATIC1111's stable diffusion web UI even without a computer able to run it.

This notebook is based on [camenduru/stable-diffusion-webui-colab](https://github.com/camenduru/stable-diffusion-webui-colab), and has been heavily modified to be more customisable and (hopefully) user friendly.
